### Naomi's whole job
## QUESTIONS: 
#### Naomi's human eyeballs question : how does clustering valuable out-door features arrange the data? Is the data evenly distributed between the clusters?
#### Naomi's computer brain question: Does the clustering algorithnm identify features that consistnely have logerror close to zero?

#### Woody question 1: Does clustering the cluster of tax_value and calc_sqft have a closer RMSE to logerror than baseline?
#### Woody question 2: ?????
